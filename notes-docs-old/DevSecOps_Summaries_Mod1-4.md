# Application Security for Developers and DevOps Professionals â€” Summaries (JDW)

This file contains condensed **learning summaries & highlights** from Modules 1â€“4.

## ðŸ§© Module 1: Introduction to Security for Application Development

- OSI model = 7 layers: Physical â†’ Data Link â†’ Network â†’ Transport â†’ Session â†’ Presentation â†’ Application.  
- Security must be embedded in the SDLC (requirements â†’ design â†’ develop â†’ test â†’ deploy).  
- **DevSecOps** = DevOps + security integration at every stage.  
- Security patterns = reusable solutions to recurring security threats.  
- TLS/SSL secure communications between clients/servers. TLS requires valid certificates and supported versions.  
- **OpenSSL** = toolkit for managing TLS/SSL, keys, certs.  
- **Nmap** = network scanner, detects hosts, services, OS, vulnerabilities. Used by admins, security professionals, penetration testers.

## ðŸ§© Module 2: Security Testing and Mitigation Strategies

- Mitigation strategies reduce risks from vulnerabilities.  
- **Static analysis (SAST):** scans source code before execution.  
- **Dynamic analysis (DAST):** tests code in execution.  
- **Secure code review**: manual + automated scanning of critical components.  
- Tools: Burp Suite, Nessus, ZAP.  
- **Runtime protection (RASP):** defends apps while running.  
- **Software Component Analysis (SCA):** detects open-source components & vulnerabilities.  
- Continuous security analysis â†’ faster feature delivery + fewer risks.

## ðŸ§© Module 3: OWASP Application Security Risks

- **OWASP Top 10** = consensus report of top web app security risks. Steps: data gathering â†’ survey â†’ analyze â†’ draft â†’ review â†’ release.  
- Key risks: Broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection (SQL, LDAP, OS command), cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure design, vulnerable/outdated components, SSRF, logging/monitoring failures.  
- **SQL injection** types: manipulation, code injection, function call injection, buffer overflow.  
- **XSS** types: stored (persistent), reflected, blind.  
- **Secrets management** = store/manage credentials via GUI, CLI, API.  
- Preventive strategies: parameterized queries, server-side validation, secure APIs, robust error handling, multifactor auth.

## ðŸ§© Module 4: Code Development Practices

- Embed security early in SDLC to save cost + reduce vulnerabilities.  
- Dependencies = external libraries â†’ speed development but must be vetted.  
- Secure error handling = avoid exposing sensitive details.  
- **Secure environment:** collaboration with security teams, monitoring/logging, restricted repo access.  
- **Insecure environment:** compromised machines, no auditing, unrestricted repo access.  

**CodeQL (GitHub):**  
- Treats code as data â†’ queries code for vulnerabilities.  
- Default (auto-config) or Advanced (custom YAML).  
- Supports: C, C++, C#, Java/Kotlin, Go, Ruby, Python, JS/TS, Swift.  
- Runs on pushes/PRs + weekly scans.
