A tiny Node.js server used to practice **application security** and **container hardening**.  
This repo documents a real pass of scanning, fixing, and locking down the image + deps.

## What we changed (short version)

- **Base image upgrades**
  - `node:hydrogen-buster` âžœ `node:20-bookworm-slim` âžœ **`node:20-alpine` (runtime)**
- **Multi-stage build**
  - Separate `build` and `runtime` stages to keep the final image small and reduce attack surface.
- **Non-root runtime**
  - Drop to the bundled `node` user (`USER node`).
- **Locked install**
  - `npm ci --omit=dev` for reproducible, minimal runtime deps.
- **Snyk triage + fixes**
  - Eliminated all **Critical/High/Medium** issues raised by Snyk for the Dockerfile path by upgrading the base image and reducing packages in the final stage.
- **Docs**
  - Archived prior Dockerfiles under `docs/prev-versions/` for traceability.

## Tooling used

- **Snyk** (SCA & container scan) â€” imported GitHub repo, scanned Dockerfile & dependencies, followed fix PR suggestions (base image alternatives).
- **GitHub** â€” branch/PR flow for Dockerfile changes.
- **(Optional) CodeQL** â€” can be enabled from **Security âžœ Code scanning** to add static queries on pushes/PRs.

---

## Reproducing the scans

### Snyk (UI)
1. Log in at <https://app.snyk.io> with GitHub.
2. **Add projects** âžœ select this repo âžœ import.
3. Open **Dockerfile** target âžœ review **Issues** âžœ apply **Alternative upgrades** (e.g., `node:20-alpine`).
4. Re-scan after each change (Snyk re-runs on push).

### Snyk CLI (optional)
```bash
# in the repo directory
npm i -g snyk
snyk auth
snyk test --docker node:20-alpine
snyk container test --file=Dockerfile .
```

# Local development
```bash
# install node deps (dev)
npm ci

# run
npm start
server listens on :8080 (see Dockerfile)
```

# Container build & run
```bash
# build the multi-stage image
docker build -t graphy-server:latest .

# run as non-root (Dockerfile sets USER node)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 graphy-server:latest
```


# Security practices applied
Least privilege: run as non-root (USER node).

Small base: use alpine for runtime to reduce packages.

Multi-stage: dev build tools never reach the final image.

Reproducible installs: npm ci and omit dev deps in runtime.

Continuous scanning: Snyk watches the repo and suggests base-image upgrades as new CVEs land.

Traceability: previous Dockerfiles stored under docs/prev-versions/.
